The first true automobile was a machine that had three wheels and was powered by steam. It was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot of France in 1769. It was heavy and moved very slowly. Many manufacturers produced steam-driven automobiles during the late 1890s and early 1900s. A disadvantage of steam was that water had to be brought to a boil before the car could go.
