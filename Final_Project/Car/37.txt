This week on The Best of Car Talk, Amy's Isuzu dies whenever she drives down a certain street. Is it electrical interference, a government experiment, or is Amy living in a remake of "The Day the Earth Stood Still"? Elsewhere, Herb's mechanic told him to deal with his turbo's noise by turning down his hearing aid; David is using a clothespin to keep his choke in place; and if Tom and Ray can diagnose Cheryl's noise, a signed photo of Sonja Henie may be on its way to Car Talk Plaza.
