This week on Car Talk, we wrap up our 30th Anniversary celebration/apology, with our all-time favorite laughs. We've got the infamous electric brakes call and the philosophical breakthrough it inspired. Also, Tom's misadventures in the US Army; the ultimate Puzzler faux pas; an appearance by Tom and Ray's dear mother, Elizabeth; a tale that epitomizes Magliozzi brotherly devotion; and the saga of Richard, his goats, and Doris. All of this, plus some entries from the listener noises Hall of Fame, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.
