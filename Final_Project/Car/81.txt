The combustion chamber in an engine is where the magic happens. It's where fuel, air, pressure, and electricity come together to create the small explosion that moves the car's pistons up and down, thus creating the power to move the vehicle. The combustion chamber is made up of the cylinder, piston, and cylinder head.
