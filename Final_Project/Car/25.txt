People not involved in the UK kit car scene may believe all kit cars are given a 'Q' registration plate which signifies a vehicle of unknown or mixed age, where in fact a significant number (majority?) do not. All kit cars are subject to a Vehicle Identity Check, VIC, by the DVLA to determine the registration mark a kit car is assigned. This will be either, a new, current year, registration; an 'age-related' registration; or a 'Q' plate.
