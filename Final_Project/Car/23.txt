The inspection (SVA equivalent) in Sweden is handled by the car builder's association SFRO who makes two inspections; one when the car has reached the rolling chassis stage and the second when the car is finished. Amateur built cars are currently limited to 15 kW (20 PS) per 100 kg. Earlier the limit was 10 kW (10 PS) per 100 kg, so for very light cars (like a Lotus 7 type car) it was a problem to find a suitable engine.
