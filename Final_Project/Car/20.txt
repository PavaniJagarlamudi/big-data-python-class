In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,in the manner of a "true aficionado" and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[38][39] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[40] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[41] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[42][43][44] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[45]
