Daisy-like with a typically yellow center and a decorative pompon, chrysanthemums symbolize optimism and joy. They're the November birth flower, the 13th wedding anniversary flower and the official flower of the city of Chicago. In Japan, there's even a "Festival of Happiness" to celebrate this flower each year.
